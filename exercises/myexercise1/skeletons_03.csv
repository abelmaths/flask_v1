So {var_4} + {var_6} + {var_8} = {ans_2}."scaffold_text,Now we divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores. So that's {var_9} / 3 = {ans_1}.corrects_required,3worked_example_start,1ans_1_wrong_01_text,The answer is {ans_1}. After adding up the scores we need to remember to divide by 3.
