question_text,Triangle ABC is a right-angle triangle. AC is {var_2}cm and angle ACB is {var_3} degrees. What is the length of {var_1}?question_text,The length of {var_1} is {ans_1}cm (1dp)hint_text,Remember to use the acronym SOHCAHTOA to help you remember which trigonometric function you needscaffold_text,"In this question we are given the hyrpotenuse (H) and we are looking for the opposite side (O). Looking at SOHCAHTOA, the trigonometric function that connects the opposite and the hypotenuse is {ans_2} (1dp)."scaffold_text,"Now that we know it is sin, we can use the formula: hypotenuse = sin(angle) x hypotenuse. Subbing our values in, we have {var_1} = sin({var_3}) x {var_2} = {ans_1}cm (1dp)"corrects_required,3worked_example_start,1ans_1_wrong_01_text,Remember to close the brackets on your calculator after working out sin({var_3}). It looks like you worked out sin({var_3} x {var_2}) instead of sin({var_3}) x {var_2}.ans_1_wrong_02_text,"Careful. Since we have the hypotenuse, and we're looking for the opposite, it is sin that we need to use; not cos. Remember the acronym SOHCAHTOA. Which part has O and H in it? It's SOH, which tells us that it is sin that we need to use."ans_1_wrong_03_text,"Careful. Since we have the hypotenuse, and we're looking for the opposite, it is sin that we need to use; not tan. Remember the acronym SOHCAHTOA. Which part has O and H in it? It's SOH, which tells us that it is sin that we need to use."ans_2_wrong_01_text,"Careful. Since we have the hypotenuse, and we're looking for the opposite, it is sin that we need to use; not cos. Remember the acronym SOHCAHTOA. Which part has O and H in it?
