question_text,Michael is holding {var_1} {var_2}. He drops {var_3} of them.question_text,image goes herequestion_text,He then picks up {var_4} {var_5}. How many things is he holding?question_text,{ans_0}mhint_text,First work out how many he is holding after he drops the first {var_3}. This is {var_1}-{var_3}. Then add on {var_4} {var_5}.scaffold_text,He originally has {var_1} {var_2}. He drops {var_3} so he is now holding {ans_1} {var_2}.scaffold_text,"Since he only now has {var_6} {var_2} and he picks up {var_4} {var_5}, he must be holding {ans_0} things."corrects_required,3worked_example_start,1ans_0_wrong_01_text,Careful to SUBTRACT what he drops ({var_3}) before adding what he picks up.ans_0_wrong_02_text,Careful to ADD what he picks up ({var_4} {var_5}) at the end onto your previous answer. Did you subtract?ans_1_wrong_01_text,Oops - you need to subtract {var_3} from {var_1} - it looks like you added them.ans_0_reveal,{var_1}-{var_3}+{var_4} = {ans_0}ans_1_reveal,{var_1}-{var_3} = {ans_1}
